# TODO
- sample environment
  - input files to test with (TestSamples to maybe start with)
- pws script: pipeline
   - input params:
      - folder path to input files
      - folder path for the output files
   - steps: 
      - find .fbx (3D model), .csv (attributes), .json (metadata) in the folder
      - parse metadata (get modelID)
      - read versionNr from .json (metadata)
      - delete content of both WorkDirectory and OutputDirectory (set of sector files can be different for different versions of the model)
      - start CadRevealComposer.exe and run the pipeline
      - rename hierarchy.db to expected_hierarchyID.db
      - write a metadata file .json for the later upload to Echo Model Distribution Service
