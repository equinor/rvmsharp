### How can you best review this? 🧐

<!-- A short description of how this should be reviewed, to help the reviewer better understand the code.
Example: This feature can be verified working as expected by observing the runtime lowered from 100 to 10 seconds on the Huldra Dataset.
         I also need a code review. I have self-commented in the review with some areas I would like to discuss if I could do this differently.
