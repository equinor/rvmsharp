### What have I made? 👩‍💻

<!-- REMINDER: The rvmsharp repo is Public! The Pull-Request MUST NOT contain any Equinor Internal information. -->

<!-- Short description of your feature / fix.
Example: Adds a faster way to parse RVM files, using a memory layout improvement for 10x better read performance. This will make parsing faster, and enable runtime parsing in client code.

### How can you best review this? 🧐

<!-- A short description of how this should be reviewed, to help the reviewer better understand the code.
Example: This feature can be verified working as expected by observing the runtime lowered from 100 to 10 seconds on the Huldra Dataset.
         I also need a code review. I have self-commented in the review with some areas I would like to discuss if I could do this differently.

### Screenshot or Profiling data 🤳 

<!-- Remove the "Screenshot or Profiling data" section if unused -->

<!-- Screenshots and gifs can be useful to understand how a feature should look or work.
Tip: Use `Windows-Shift-S` to take a quick screenshot, and press `Ctrl-V` to auto embed the image.
REMINDER: The rvmsharp repo is Public! Consider if screenshots would contain internal information.
          Screenshots of 3D models should either be of the Huldra dataset or be unidentifiable to where and what is imaged.
