## Issue Guideline

If you find some nice optimizations or tricks, bugs or feature requests: do not hesitate to create an issue discussing if it should be implemented in the the `rvmsharp` project.

While any code contributions are appreciated please make an issue to discuss the approach before implementing a major change.
This helps both us and you set expectations, and avoids unnecessary work :)
