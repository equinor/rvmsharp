## Information about the Huldra dataset

Through the lifetime of an asset, Equinor is collecting large amounts of Life Cycle Information. This could be technical information, maintenance information or the 3D model of the asset. Equinor has a large portfolio of plant 3D models, which is continually maintained and updated by our contractors through the lifespan of the asset.

One of these assets is Huldra. The field was developed with a wellhead and process facility, unmanned, and remotely operated from Veslefrikk B. Production started in 2001 and ended in 2014. The plant was decommissioned in 2019 and 97% of material recycled. The 3D plant model for Huldra is a result of Equinor early studies, and then matured in detail by contractor Aker Kv√¶rner and Rosenberg Verft in the construction phase of the plant. Equinor has then in collaboration with our contractors, maintained this 3D model through the lifetime of Huldra and used it to support all activities in operation maintenance and modifications.

The 3D model now represents the as-built status of Huldra when it ended production in 2014. The 3D model, in addition to the visual appearance contain attributes as TAG, meaning that we can connect the 3D model with the correct technical from other Equinor systems. This is a key element in our digital twin solution that aims to connect data from different source systems.

Equinor is using the 3D model as part of our digital twin development, development of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality solutions and we want to enable others, to use the same data for innovations that could contribute to new ways of working.
