# Convert InstanceMeshes when too few in a sector

## [Refernce branch](https://github.com/equinor/rvmsharp/tree/Spike/ConvertInstanceMeshesWhenTooFew)

## Goal

Try to avoid using instance meshes where there are too few occuring internally in a sector. This will hopefully have a positive effect on the performance.

## Method

During splitting, just before the sector is completed, the number of instances per instance id is checked. If the number is lower than a set threshold, convert them to triangle meshes instead. 

The threshold is currently just an arbitrary set number.

## Evidence

How should this be tested?

## Conclusion

## Next steps

Find a threshold that makes sense.
